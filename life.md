#Life of an instruction
In this document, we will describe the life of an instruction i.e., the complete cycle of compiling, lifting and recompiling for a single instruction.

### Inside the binary

In a compiled binary, a garden variety basic block would look like:

Let's focus on just **addiu** for now
![image](addiu_dis.png)



Here, the instruction contains 
1 opcode (addiu)
3 operands (2 registers and 1 immediate)

The lifting process of **binary to IR** happends in two steps.
The first step is to recover the control flow graph and other disassmeblt information fom the binary, and store it in a serialized fomrt.

The format is defined using protocl buffer and for a single instruction, the defined format looks like:
![image](protocol_buffer.png)
```
// An instruction inside of a block.
message Instruction {
  required  int64           ea = 1;
  required  bytes           bytes = 2;
  repeated  CodeReference   xrefs = 3;
  optional  bool            local_noreturn = 4;

  // Address of the landing pad
  optional  uint64          lp_ea = 5;
  required  bool            has_ref_info = 6;
}
```

For now, focus only on 

- Effective Address(ea=1)
- Instruction bytes(bytes=2)

For the above mentioned instruction , what goes in the CFG is:
```
" you can also paste the capstone output, 
  but i think this looks more neat"
Instruction {
 ea = 0x400580;
 bytes = "27 BD FB A0"
 }
```

Before moving onto the second step, let's discuss about **addiu**.
From the MIPS32 ISA specification:

####delete this: {
To decode this Instruction, we use masking on the extracted bytes stored in the CFG file to obtain the various instruction fields.
In this case, namely: **register rt, register rs, 16 bit immediate**

####}

Now going by ISAâ€™s specification, the 16 bit value is sign-extended to 23 bits, added to the 32 bit value in register < rs > . The result is stored inside register < rt >.

Now, to emulate the same behaviour, we define this semantic behaviour of the instruction using C++ templates.

Immediate values can be passed as is, but for registers, a structure called ```state``` is defined, whose members are mnemonic names of the architecture/hardware registers.
All semantic functions operate on these state's register to emulate operation on hardware registers.

Let's compile this semantic function to LLVM IR (bitcode)
![image](compiled_semantic.png)

Now for the second step of lifting, the disassembly information in CFG is read, and IR is generated accordingly

The general procedure is to generate a LLVM function for every function name in the CFG, then within the function, create a LLVM basic block for every Basic block in the CFG, and every instruction in a basic block is replaced with it's semantic function. 

Lastly, some optimizations are performed on the bitcode, like

- inlining the call to the semantic functions
- aggresive dead code elimination.
- mem2reg promotion.
- others

In the end, the finalized IR looks like:

so where is the addiu from the dissassmbly?
the semantic function simulates the semantic behaviour of an instructions. The actual LLVM instructions generated are totally up to the compiler.

Let's trace our addiu in this IR.

**Let's compile this back to assembly. The resultant assembly looks like:**

conclusion? that's how a single instruction in the original binary ends up being represented by multiple instructions, operating on the state structure, to simulate the same behaviour.
